# Introduction to PyTorch

A series of notebooks that explore how to use the PyTorch framework to:

- manipulate tensors (i.e. as an alternative to NumPy);
- perform auto-differentiation and minimise arbitrary functions;
- build and train ML models from first principles; and,
- build and train deep learning models.

## Dependencies

All 3rd party Python packages required to run the notebook are contained in the `requirements.txt` file. We recommend that they are installed into a new virtual environment - e.g. with the following sequence of commands executed from your terminal,

```shell
$ python3 -m venv .venv
$ source .venv/bin/activate
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
