# Data Science and Machine Learning Notebooks

This repository contains examples and proof-of-concept code for various topics and tools used within the areas of practical data science, data engineering and machine learning. Each directory within this project is a stand-alone mini-project with it's own Python package requirements.

## Contents

- **Dagster** - for engineering data pipelines.
- **DVC** - for basic version control of ML artefacts (e.g., models and datasets).
- **DVC Pipelines** - for orchestrating data science workflows, tracking artefacts and their lineage.
- **Ibis** - a unified interface for expressing analytical queries, regardless of data source.
- **MLflow** - for managing ML models.
- **PyTorch** - for tensor manipulation, auto-differentiation and deep learning.
- **SpaCy** - for Natural Language Processing (NLP) pipelines.
- **SqlAlchemy** - for Object Relational Mapping (ORM).
