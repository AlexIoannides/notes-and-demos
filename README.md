# Data Science & ML Notebook

This repository contains examples and Proof-of-Concept (PoC) code for various topics and tools used within the areas of practical Data Science (DS), Data Engineering (DE) and Machine Learning (ML). All demos can be found within the `demos` folder and sub-directory within this is a stand-alone mini-project with it's own Python package requirements.

## Contents

- **DVC Pipelines** - for orchestrating data science workflows, tracking artefacts and their lineage.
- **Ibis** - a unified interface for expressing analytical queries, regardless of data source.
- **MLflow** - for managing ML models.
- **PyTorch** - for tensor manipulation, auto-differentiation and deep learning.
