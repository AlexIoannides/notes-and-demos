# Ibis

Ibis aims to provide a single API for composing analytical queries from a variety of database 'backends' - e.g., PostgeSQL, PySpark, Pandas, etc. The API closely resembles the PySpark DataFrame API - i.e., the aim is to represent SQL expressions using Python code.

The `ibis_introduction.ipynb` notebook demonstrates how to achieve basic operations - e.g., reading tables, creating new columns, aggregating, joining etc. For more information refer to the [Ibis documentation](https://ibis-project.org/docs/latest/).
