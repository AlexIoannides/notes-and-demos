# Managing the ML Lifecycle using MLflow

The ML lifecycle covers the following stages of a ML engineering project:

* data preparation
* training
* deployment

[MLflow](https://mlflow.org) is an open-source framework that supports the ML lifecycle by tracking training metrics, storing trained models and model deployment.

## Demo Objectives

* How to setup and configure MLflow.
* How to track metrics.
* How to track metrics during hyper-parameter optimisation.
* How to save a model to the MLflow registry.
* How to retrieve the latest model tagged for production.
* How to serve model predictions via a REST API.

## Running the Demo

This demo is contained within a single Jupyter notebook - `demos/mlflow/mlflow_basics.ipynb`. Make sure you have the necessary Python package requirements installed into a Jupyter kernel for it to run successfully.
