# Introduction to PyTorch

[PyTorch](https://pytorch.org) is a ML framework that provides NumPy-like tensor computation together with the fundamental building blocks for constructing and training deep learning models.

## Demo Objectives

* How to manipulate tensors - i.e., PyTorch as an alternative to NumPy.
* How to use auto-differentiation and minimise arbitrary functions.
* How to create custom data loaders for efficient model training.
* How to build and train ML models from first principles - linear and logistic regression.
* How to build and train a deep learning model for image classification.

## Running the Demo

This demo spans several Jupyter notebook:

* `demos/pytorch/tensors.ipynb`.
* `demos/pytorch/linear_regression.ipynb`.
* `demos/pytorch/logistic_regression.ipynb`.
* `demos/pytorch/MNIST.ipynb`.

Make sure you have the necessary Python package requirements installed into a Jupyter kernel for it to run successfully.
