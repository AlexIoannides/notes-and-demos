# Object Relation Mapping using SQL Alchemy

[SQL Alchemy](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/14/index.html) is a Python package providing tools that facilitate structured database interaction via Python objects - i.e., for [Object-Relational Mapping (ORM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectâ€“relational_mapping). [Alembic](https://alembic.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/) is a Python package for managing database migrations based on the data models implied by the SQL Alchemy models - i.e., Python classes.

## Demo Objectives

* How to define a data model using SQL Alchemy
* How to interact with a database via SQL Alchemy's ORM.
* How to use Alembic to manage database schema migrations.

## Dependencies

This demo is contained primarily within a single Jupyter notebook - `demos/sqlalchemy/sql-alchemy-basics.ipynb`, that calls upon data models defined in `demos/sqlalchemy/models.py`. Make sure you have the necessary Python package requirements installed into a Jupyter kernel for it to run successfully.
