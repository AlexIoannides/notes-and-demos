# DVC Pipelines

We build upon the introductory DVC demo and add the tracking of ML artefact lineage from data and the underlying ML pipeline source code.

## Demo Objectives

* How to initialise a DVC pipelines project.
* How to develop a ML pipeline for use with DVC.
* How to run a ML pipeline via DVC and track the resulting artefacts.
* How to retrieve pipeline run metrics.

## Running the Demo

This demo is contained within a single Jupyter notebook - `dvc_pipelines.ipynb`. Make sure you have the necessary Python package requirements installed into a Jupyter kernel for it to run successfully.
