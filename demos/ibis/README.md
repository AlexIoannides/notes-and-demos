# Ibis

[Ibis](http://ibis-project.org/) is a Python package that aims to provide a single API for composing analytical queries from a variety of database 'backends' - e.g., PostgeSQL, PySpark, Pandas, etc. The API closely resembles the PySpark DataFrame API - i.e., the aim is to represent SQL expressions using Python code.
